# Models Folder

This folder stores **trained models and related artifacts**.

## Files

Depending on which scripts you have run, you may see some or all of the following:

- `xgb_model.pkl`  
  Final trained **XGBoost** classifier.  
  Created by `src/train_xgb.py`.

- `catboost_model.pkl`  
  Final trained **CatBoost** classifier.  
  Created by `src/train_catboost.py`.

- `xgb_checkpoint.pkl`  
  Checkpoint for XGBoost incremental training.  
  Contains a dictionary with:
  - `"model"` — current `XGBClassifier`
  - `"rounds"` — number of trees trained so far  
  Used by `src/train_xgb.py` to resume training instead of starting from scratch.

- `catboost_checkpoint.pkl`  
  Checkpoint for CatBoost incremental training.  
  Contains:
  - `"model"` — current `CatBoostClassifier`
  - `"rounds"` — number of iterations trained so far  
  Used by `src/train_catboost.py` to resume training.

- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`  
  Fitted `TfidfVectorizer` used to transform raw text into feature vectors.  
  Shared between XGBoost and CatBoost so that both models use the same representation.  
  Created in the training scripts after calling `build_tfidf(...)`.

- `ensemble_config.json`  
  Configuration of the best soft-voting ensemble found on the validation set.  
  Created by `src/ensemble.py`.  
  Typically contains:
  - `w_xgb` — weight for XGBoost probabilities
  - `w_cb` — weight for CatBoost probabilities
  - `threshold` — decision threshold on the combined probability
  - `best_F1_macro_val` — macro F1 score on the validation set for this configuration.

## Usage

- For training:
  - Scripts in `src/` will **write** checkpoints and final models into this folder.
- For inference:
  - Load `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` and a chosen model (e.g. `xgb_model.pkl`) to run predictions on new comments.
- For experiments:
  - Checkpoints allow you to continue training on another machine/run without losing progress.

Large model files are usually not committed to Git. They can be regenerated by re-running the training scripts or stored in a separate model registry or artifact store.
